There are 3 main modes of operation, specified by command line parameters.
There is a configuration in the form of a Python dictionary that is passed to the Robot class constructor. This configuration comes from different sources depending on the mode of operation.

main.py is in the client folder.

python3 main.py

This was meant to be the default operation when the project was first started. It was going to be each robot simulator running on a different computer so that networking options could be explored more. But the project took a different direction and this mode is not as useful any more. Now it is used for seeing 1 single robot explore 1 map. In this mode, you can press enter for each step of robot movement.

The configuration for this mode is read from config.txt

python3 main.py 1

python3 main.py 2

Since we didn't set up multiple computers to work together, this mode of operation is for seeing 2 robots explore 1 map. It is to be run in 2 different consoles, started at close to the same time.

The configuration for this mode comes from main.py under DEMO_OPTIONS

---

python3 main.py d

This is the mode used to collect lots of data automatically. It will print a list of all of the samples at the end of each map. It has to run for a few hours to collect a good amount of data.

The configurations for this mode are iteratively generated in main.py data_gather_sequence and one_set
